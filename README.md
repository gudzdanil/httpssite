To work with front-end files:

1. run `npm install`
2. build files
  1. for production
    * build (output to `/dist`): run `npm run build`
    * build minified files (output to `/dist`): run `npm run prod`
  2. for development
    * first start - `npm start` (runs `npm run build && npm run dev`)
    * run local dev server: run `npm run dev`
